## Welcome to Diabotical District

Our community aims to give new and less experienced Diabotical players the opportunity to enjoy regular competitive match play and connect with other players to train and improve their game. 

The league is designed primarily for fun but it's also a great way to learn and track your progress. Matches will be live on Twitch with casting. 

We hope this community can help bring fresh players to the game and demystify the basics of AFPS to share what we love about this genre.
